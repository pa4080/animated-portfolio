# About this project

**Note:** This project is not my actual portfolio, but it is a part of it where I've gained experience with animations in React.js. My main portfolio is will be available soon at **[spasov.me](https://spasov.me)**

Welcome to this project! Although this is not my main portfolio, it serves as a showcase of my skills and experience in working with animations in React.js. Throughout this project, I have explored various techniques and libraries to create engaging and interactive user interfaces.

Please feel free to explore the different features and components implemented here. Keep in mind that this project is focused on basic animations by using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion) and may not represent the full range of my skills and expertise. If you have any questions or would like to see more examples of my work, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting and taking the time to explore this project! Please fell free to [contact me](/#Contact) if you have any questions or feedback.
